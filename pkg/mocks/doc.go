/*
Package mocks includes all the mocks required by the tests of the packages in pkg folder.

Mockery (https://github.com/vektra/mockery) is being used to generate the mocks.

	* Mockery must be installed locally
	* To generate all of them `$ make _mock`
	* Once generated, one would need to fix all the mocks imports
